# CountryPicker
Demo Shiny code for Coursera Developing Data Products course.

## Shiny app (`app.r`)

The Shiny app shows an interactive world map using the `rworldmap` package that allows the 
user to select countries to highlight using a `inputText` widet.

Documentation is included in a separate "instructions" tab.

## Presentation

The code for the presentation is included in this repository, but it is also available on [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/Otepoti/CountryPicker).

The five slides include one that runs code to present some stats calculated from the example country data,
and one that plots the default map.
